As we can see the number of unpaid reviews is the majority of our data.  Only 39% of the unpaid reviews have five star rating and 51% of the paid reviews have five star rating.


## Summary 

It appears to be a significant difference between the 5 stars reviews of the vine program compared to the non paid reviews.  Therefore, the results indicate a potential bias for reviews in the vine program.  An additional study can be done including more data of the verified purchases and of the different demographics. A sentiment analysis can be performed to identify the overall image of products on the web.
